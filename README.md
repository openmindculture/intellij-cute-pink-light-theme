# Cute Pink Light Theme

<!-- Plugin description -->
[Cute Pink Light Theme](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16721-cute-pink-light-theme) is a light IDE theme for JetBrains IDEs (PhpStorm, WebStorm, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.) inspired by [a theme for VisualStudio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=webfreak.cute-theme). This theme adds cute pink colors to your IDE, keeping the default light theme for editor and unchanged syntax highlighting. Based on JetBrains default light theme.


**BETA: This theme is usable, but still unfinished!**

If you like to support development, you can open a pull request [on GitHub](https://github.com/openmindculture/intellij-cute-pink-light-theme).

For JetBrains IDEs, version 2020.2 and above. Version 1.0.0 has been tested up to 2024.1 (244) EAP and should also support later IDEA versions.

To install:
- Go to Settings (Preferences) | Plugins, find the theme plugin and install it
- (_or_ download [Cute Pink Light Theme from JetBrains Plugins page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16721-cute-pink-light-theme))

If you only want to install the theme, you do not need this repository.
You can install the theme from JB marketplace (inside your IDE) or install zip file (see below).

### Local Installation

In `build/distributions` there is a zip file that I can manually import into my regular PhpStorm installation (Settings -> Plugins -> Gear Icon -> install plugin from disk).

### Development

[Cute Pink Light Theme (openmindculture/intellij-cute-pink-light-theme)](https://github.com/openmindculture/intellij-cute-pink-light-theme)
can be used as an upstream repository for variations like
[Cute Pink Dark Theme (intellij-cute-pink-dark-theme)](https://github.com/openmindculture/intellij-cute-pink-dark-theme).

```
git checkout git@github.com:openmindculture/intellij-cute-pink-dark-theme.git
cd intellij-cute-pink-dark-theme.git
git remote add upstream git@github.com:openmindculture/intellij-cute-pink-light-theme.git
```

The initial settings for the formerly recommended development environment, IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, as described by JetBrains in the [custom UI theme workflow](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/themes.html#custom-ui-theme-workflow), has been removed in favor of a simple build script since release 1.0.0. You can also create a zip file manually, see the instructions below.

For creating future theme plugins, you do not need a complex Gradle setup, as there is a new
wizard for creating a UI theme. See:
- https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/2021/10/themes-in-intellij-based-ides/
- https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/theme-structure.html

> A plugin consisting of a single .jar file is placed in the /plugins directory.

To find out the internal names of UI elements, we can now use the [UI inspector](https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/2021/10/themes-in-intellij-based-ides/#UI_Inspector%EF%BB%BF):
> The UI Inspector is a powerful tool to investigate the IntelliJ-based IDE UI elements to get an internal description of each element. In addition, UI elements can be tested interactively with Ctrl+Alt+Click on the element.
>
> Before using the UI Inspector, it must be enabled by selecting the menu item Tools | Internal Actions | UI | UI Inspector. The enabled state of the UI Inspector is modal; it remains enabled until it is disabled by selecting the menu item again.
>
> If the menu item Tools | Internal Actions is not available in IntelliJ IDEA, then the first step is [Enabling Internal Mode](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/enabling-internal.html):
>
> From the main menu, select Help | Edit Custom Properties... This selection opens IntelliJ IDEA's idea.properties file. If it does not exist, IntelliJ IDEA will prompt to create one.
>
> Add the line shown below to the idea.properties file:
>
> `idea.is.internal=true`
> Save the idea.properties file and restart IntelliJ IDEA.

### Development, Build and Export

- Edit colors in `src/main/META-INF/cute_pink_light_theme.json`.
- As a contributor:
  - create a pull request on GitHub.
- As a maintainer:
  - Edit theme version, supported IDE versions, and other data, in 
    - `src/main/resources/META-INF/plugin.xml`
    - `src/main/resources/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`
    - `package.json`
    - `gradle.properties` (only used for IntelliJ gradle build)
    - `build.gradle.kts` (only used for IntelliJ gradle build)
  - Build using one of the methods described below. 
  - Add a change log in `CHANGELOG.md`. 
  - Add a git tag, create a release, and add the theme zip.
  - Upload the theme zip to JetBrains marketplace.

#### Shell Build (beta)

`npm run build`

- requires `bash`/`sh`!
- creates a `build/distributions/intellij-cute-pink-light-theme-x.y.z.zip`

#### Alternative Manual Export (without IntelliJ Build Process)

Create an archive `intellij-cute-pink-light-theme-x.y.z.zip` containing:
  - `intellij-cute-pink-light-theme/` 
    - `lib/`
      - `intellij-cute-pink-light-theme-x.y.z.jar`
        The `.jar` file is another zip archive containing the contents of `src/main/resources`
        with **no additional folder in between, e.g.:
          - `cute_pink_light.theme.json`
          - `cute_pink_light.xml`
          - `META-INF/`
            - `plugin.xml`
            - `pluginIcon.svg`
            - `MANIFEST.MF`

A valid `MANIFEST.MF` example is included to simplify theme export and update.

You can use the build script `./build.sh $version` to build, e.g.
`./build.sh 2.9.0`

#### Fix Problems and Incompatibilities

If the build does not run anymore, try to

- upgrade dependencies if necessary
- merge upgrades from [IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-plugin-template)
- look up error messages, issues, workarounds in [YouTrack](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/)
- set VM options `--add-opens=java.base/java.io=ALL-UNNAMED --illegal-access=deny` to Run Verifications task as a workaround for [IDEA-210683 Illegal reflective access in IJ codebase](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-210683) and possibly also in general Java / Kotlin options in IDE settings
- use a current IntelliJ IDEA version (evaluation version should be enough)
- [clear IntelliJ cache folders](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360003086459-kotlin-gradle-dsl-type-mismatch-expected-java-lang-string-but-inferred-type-is-kotlin-string) (`rm -rf ~/.cache/JetBrains/*`)
- clear gradle cache (`rm -rf ~/.gradle/caches/*`)
- (re)build project

#### Upgrade Plugin for new IDEA versions

- bump plugin version
- add current IDEA version to supported targets
- rebuild artifacts as described above
